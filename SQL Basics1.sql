--These are my queries from SQL Playground on Team Treehouse to finish up the first part of SQL Basics course:
--'Getting Data From a Database'.

-- What are all the movies in our database?
SELECT * FROM movies;

-- How do you find all the actors in database?
SELECT * FROM actors;

-- Find all the reviews in the database
SELECT * FROM reviews;

-- Only bring back those two columns
SELECT title, year_released FROM movies;

-- Bring back only one column
SELECT name FROM actors;

-- Can you find all the usernames and their ratings (a number between 1 and 5) from the reviews table?

-- From the movies table, alias the title and year_released as Movie Title and Release Year respectively
SELECT title AS 'Movie Title', year_released AS 'Release Year' FROM movies;

-- From the actors table, alias the name as Actor Name
SELECT name AS 'Actor Name' FROM actors;
